    <h1> Bhuvaneswaridevi Ghanta</h1>
    <h6>Tirupati</h6>
    <p><b>Tirupati</b> is one of my favourite destination spot in <b>India</b>.Tirupati, 
        we can understand the unique aspects that make the place holy and beautiful.
        As the temple is situated at an elevation of 850 metres, people can enjoy 
        the mesmerising sights around. With sacred waterfalls and tanks, 
        the temple offers a visual treat to our eyes due to its ancient, elegant architecture.</p>
